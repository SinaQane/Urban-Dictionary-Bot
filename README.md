# Urban-Dictionary-Bot
A Telegram bot for searching the word definitions on urbandictionary.com

It's written in Python 3 and for Telegram but you can simply use the scrapping code to use it anywhere else since there ia no official API for Urban Dictionary.

It can reply messages in private conversation with the bot, and use inline mode in private conversations and group chats without being added to the group.

## Setup
First install requirements
```python
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Then just change the `TOKEN` with your robot token and run it. 

## Usage

Use it as inline bot in private chats or groups by calling ID of bot:
```python
@Urban_dic_bot Example
```
